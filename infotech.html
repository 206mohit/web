        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm delighted to have the opportunity to introduce myself. My name is mohit patil, and I'm currently in my second year pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. 

            In my first year, I gained a solid foundation in programming languages and delving into the fundamentals of computer architecture and digital logic design. I've also had the chance to work on various projects, both individually and in teams.
            
             I enjoy participating in coding competitions, attending tech meetups, and engaging in online forums where I can learn from and contribute to the community.
            
            Looking ahead, I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in my academic journey. I'm eager to deepen my knowledge in areas such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, and I'm also keen to undertake internships and gain practical experience in the industry.
            
            Ultimately, my goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to make meaningful contributions to the field of technology and to help solve real-world problems through innovative solutions.
